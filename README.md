The Antelope NFT metadata standards are a collection of fields to use when creating your schema on atomic acids. We provide copy-paste, plug-and-play schemas that work with the most popular markets on both US and WAX, starting with [Atomichub](https://wax.atomichub.io/), [NFThive](https://nfthive.com/), [WAXdao](https://waxdao.com/) and more. 


# Learn how to use in the [Instructional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXjBQnV_Xm8) made for our similar [Music NFT standard](https://github.com/currentxchange/Music-NFT-Standard). 

## Implementation Options

You'll find code blocks for the various NFT Standards in this README.md

You can either copy/paste them, as shown in the [Instructional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXjBQnV_Xm8) or simply create a new schema on [Atomichub.io](https://wax.atomichub.io/) and type in each field you would like to Implementation

# RAM Note
While you may see more fields than you'd like to implement in your final NFT, it's okay to use them for the schema. This will make the ram requirement of schema creation slightly larger, but you'll only be charged for the fields you use when creating templates / NFTs./



> This metadata is written specifically for Atomic Asset's [NFT standard](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract) on the [atomicassets contract](https://wax.bloks.io/account/atomicassets). Feel free to copy the code to other blockchains like NEAR, Ethereum, Cardano, etc.

Feel free to fork, or open an issue to see improvement.
